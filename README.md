# Repository for the documents for Bitcoin insurance and risk.


We are developing two risk tools to implement a complete captive insurance model. In traditional insurance, the asset being insured is typically not something the insurance company can protect. However, when it comes to insuring bitcoin, our wallet provides better security for our insureds' bitcoin. Our first tool is an AI-infused risk dashboard that will have two databases. The first database will be proactive bitcoin risk research, including bitcoin cryptography, seed phrase creation, transaction risk, and the defi stack. The second database will be a collection of reactive-based data, such as blacklisted addresses, known phishing scams, risk trends, transaction screeners, and an all-around vector database for all things risk. Captive insurance companies are used as a risk management tool by businessesThey offer the ability to tailor coverage for hard-to-insure or emerging risks, apply alternative strategies to deal with insurance market cycles, provide financial incentives for loss control, offer flexibility in managing risk, offer creative insurance solutions, allocate costs to business units, and consolidate risk management. Captive insurance is a strategic risk management tool that can provide bespoke coverage, cost efficiencies, and profit potential
