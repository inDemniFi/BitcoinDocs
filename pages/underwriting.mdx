Underwriting

Underwriting is a critical component of insurance risk management, and our project incorporates several elements to ensure effective underwriting. Here are some of the key considerations we have taken into account:

1. Big data analysis: Our AI-infused risk dashboard leverages big data analysis to carry out risk assessments of policyholders. This allows us to analyze historical data and identify trends and patterns that can inform our underwriting decisions.
2. Proactive and reactive risk data: Our risk dashboard includes two databases - one for proactive bitcoin risk research and another for reactive-based data. This allows us to stay up-to-date on emerging risks and trends and respond quickly to new threats.
3. Tailored coverage: Captive insurance allows us to tailor coverage for hard-to-insure or emerging risks that may not be covered by traditional insurance policies. This allows us to provide more comprehensive coverage to our policyholders.
4. Investment income: Our captive insurance company can generate investment income to fund losses, which can help us manage our risks more effectively.
5. Direct access to reinsurance markets: Our captive insurance company provides us with direct access to wholesale reinsurance markets, which can help us obtain coverage at a lower cost.
6. Funding and underwriting flexibility: Our captive insurance company offers us greater flexibility in funding and underwriting our own insurance, which can help us manage our risks more effectively.
