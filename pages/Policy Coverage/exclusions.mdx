### Exclusions

Our policy provides coverage for a range of risks related to Bitcoin assets. However, there are certain exclusions that policyholders should be aware of. These exclusions are designed to ensure that our policy remains sustainable and that we are able to provide high-quality coverage to our policyholders. Here are the exclusions:

1. No incident is insurable if not approved specifically within 2 blocks of initial transaction approval from our transaction screener. This exclusion is designed to ensure that policyholders take appropriate steps to protect their Bitcoin assets and that they are aware of any potential risks associated with their transactions.
2. Will not indemnify an exploit from non white-listed wallets. This exclusion is designed to ensure that policyholders are using reputable and trustworthy wallets to store their Bitcoin assets. Using non white-listed wallets can increase the risk of loss or theft, and we are not able to provide coverage for these types of risks.
3. We will not insure against the transaction of selling a token or NFT for which you did not request, or have been "airdropped." This exclusion is designed to ensure that policyholders are aware of the risks associated with selling tokens or NFTs that they did not request or receive through an airdrop. These types of transactions can be risky and we are not able to provide coverage for these types of risks.
4. No loss of funds is insurable if you did not "approve" of the function. This exclusion is designed to ensure that policyholders are aware of the risks associated with certain functions related to Bitcoin assets. If a policyholder did not approve of a certain function, we are not able to provide coverage for any resulting loss of funds.
5. Losses from systemic events like or similar to the ones below are excluded:
    51% attack
    DDoS attack
    Long Range attack
    P+ Epsilon attack
    Sybil attack

This exclusion is designed to ensure that policyholders are aware of the risks associated with systemic events that can impact the Bitcoin network. These types of events can be difficult to predict and we are not able to provide coverage for these types of risks. In conclusion, our policy provides coverage for a range of risks related to Bitcoin assets. However, there are certain exclusions that policyholders should be aware of. These exclusions are designed to ensure that our policy remains sustainable and that we are able to provide high-quality coverage to our policyholders. By carefully managing our exclusions, we are able to provide tailored coverage to our policyholders while maintaining a sustainable business model.

It is important to note that the exclusions listed above may vary depending on the specific policy and insurance company. Policyholders should review their policy documents carefully and contact their insurance company directly with any questions or concerns. Additionally, policyholders should ensure that they comply with the terms and conditions of the policy to ensure that they are covered in the event of a loss or damage.
