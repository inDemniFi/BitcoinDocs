Our insurance policy provides coverage for a range of risks related to Bitcoin assets. To ensure that policyholders understand the terms and conditions of our policy, we have provided a list of key conditions below:

1. Pre-tx screener: Every transaction must run through our pre-tx screener. This is designed to ensure that policyholders take appropriate steps to protect their Bitcoin assets and that they are aware of any potential risks associated with their transactions.
2. Approval from pre-tx screener: Every transaction must have a Pass, or specific approval from our pre-tx screener. This is designed to ensure that policyholders are aware of any potential risks associated with their transactions and that they are taking appropriate steps to protect their Bitcoin assets.
3. Current version of wallets: Policyholders must be utilizing the most current version of wallets available. This is designed to ensure that policyholders are using reputable and trustworthy wallets to store their Bitcoin assets. Using outdated wallets can increase the risk of loss or theft, and we are not able to provide coverage for these types of risks.
4. DeFi related loss of funds: Any DeFi related loss of funds must be from a protocol deployed after the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade. This is designed to ensure that policyholders are aware of the risks associated with DeFi protocols and that they are taking appropriate steps to protect their Bitcoin assets.

In addition to these conditions, it is important to note that our policy provides coverage for a range of losses related to Bitcoin assets, including theft, loss, and damage. The specific types of losses that are covered are specified in the policy along with the Coverage and Exclusions pages.
