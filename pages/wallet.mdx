## Future Risk Wallet Installation Instructions
```js filename="BitcoinDevKit SDK Info" {3} copy
Because of BitcoinDevKit and their SDK, we can build an "air-gapped" or "Offline" wallet;
that physically can't connect to the Bitcoin network. It will still be able to generate;
addresses and sign PSBTs, but with a greatly reduced attack surface;
because a sizablepart of the code that handles the logic to synchronize with the network;
would be entirely omitted in the final executable binary.;
