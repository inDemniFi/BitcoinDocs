## Future Risk Wallet Installation Instructions
```js filename="BitcoinDevKit SDK Info" {3} copy
Because of BitcoinDevKit and their SDK, we can build an "air-gapped" or "Offline" wallet
that physically can't connect to the Bitcoin network. It will still be able to generate
addresses and sign PSBTs, but with a greatly reduced attack surface
because a sizablepart of the code that handles the logic to synchronize with the network
would be entirely omitted in the final executable binary.

    a. Our wallet product offers a unique feature that sets it apart from other Bitcoin wallets on the market. Thanks to BitcoinDevKit and their SDK, we are able to build an "air-gapped" or "Offline" wallet that physically can't connect to the Bitcoin network. This feature provides a range of benefits          to users, including:
            1. Reduced attack surface: Because a sizable part of the code that handles the logic to synchronize with the network would be entirely omitted in the final executable binary, our Offline wallet has a greatly reduced attack surface. This makes it more secure and less vulnerable to hacking or                 other types of attacks.
            2. Address generation: Our Offline wallet is still able to generate addresses, which allows users to receive Bitcoin payments even when they are not connected to the network. This provides greater flexibility and convenience for users who may not always have access to the internet.
            3. PSBT signing: Our Offline wallet is also able to sign PSBTs, which allows users to securely authorize Bitcoin transactions even when they are not connected to the network. This provides greater security and peace of mind for users who may be concerned about the risks associated with                      online transactions.
            4. Practicality: While other offline wallets may not be practical for day-to-day use, our Offline wallet is designed with usability in mind. It is easy to use and provides a range of features that make it a practical choice for users who want to manage their Bitcoin assets securely and   `                  conveniently.
6. Fast and reliable: Our wallet is designed to be fast and reliable, with quick transaction processing times and high uptime.
