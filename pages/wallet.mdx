## Future Risk Wallet Installation Instructions
```js filename="BitcoinDevKit snippet" {3} copy
we can build an "air-gapped" or "Offline" wallet. Basically, we can make a wallet that physically can't connect to the Bitcoin network. It will still be able to generate addresses and sign PSBTs (opens new window), but with a greatly reduced attack surface because a sizable part of the code that handles the logic to synchronize with the network would be entirely omitted in the final executable binary.;

console.log(a);
```
