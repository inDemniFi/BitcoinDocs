### Capital

Managing premiums and investing them through managers to grow the capital and deploy it upon the need of a claim being filed is a critical component of our product. In this article, we will discuss the types of investments, the role of investment managers, and the investment policies that guide the investment of our capital. Types of Investments Investing involves deploying capital (money) toward projects or activities that are expected to generate a positive return over time. The type of returns that can be generated from investments can vary widely, depending on the type of investment and the level of risk involved. Some of the most common types of investments include:

1. Equities: Equities are stocks or shares in a company. Investing in equities involves buying a stake in a company and sharing in its profits and losses.
2. Fixed income: Fixed income investments are investments that provide a fixed rate of return over a set period of time. Examples of fixed income investments include bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs).
3. Real estate: Real estate investments involve buying and selling property, such as homes, commercial buildings, and land. Real estate investments can provide a steady stream of income through rental income and appreciation in property values.
4. Alternative investments: Alternative investments are investments that fall outside of traditional asset classes, such as equities, fixed income, and real estate. Examples of alternative investments include hedge funds, private equity, and commodities.

Role of Investment Managers Investment managers play a critical role in managing and growing the capital of our captive insurance model. Our team of experienced investment managers has a deep understanding of the Bitcoin market and is able to make informed investment decisions to grow our capital and ensure that we are able to pay out claims when required. The investment managers are responsible for managing the assets of our captive insurance model. They follow a comprehensive investment policy that guides the investment of our capital. This policy defines the nature and purpose of our investment portfolio, and details the long-term objectives of our captive insurance model and the investment structure that will be employed to meet these objectives. Investment Policies Our investment policy addresses the issue of asset allocation, which is a critical factor in determining the risk and rewards of our investment portfolio. We carefully balance our investments to ensure that we are able to generate sufficient returns to fund our operations and provide coverage to our policyholders, while also managing risk appropriately. Our investment policy also defines our investment goals and objectives, which are focused on generating long-term returns and ensuring the financial stability of our captive insurance model. We carefully monitor our investments to ensure that they are aligned with our goals and objectives, and make adjustments as needed to ensure that we remain on track. We regularly review the performance of our investments to ensure that we are generating sufficient returns to fund our operations and provide coverage to our policyholders. We use a range of metrics to evaluate our performance, including return on investment, risk-adjusted return, and portfolio diversification.
